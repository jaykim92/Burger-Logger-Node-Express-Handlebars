# Burger-Logger-Node-Express-Handlebars
## Project Description
This web application was created as a demonstration of my understanding of several technologies. I used Handlebars as a templating engine for the front end, JavaScript, as well as the Bootstrap library and custom CSS. For the back-end, I used Express, Node, and My SQL with custom ORM.

This app can be used to add to a list of burgers the user wishes to eat in the future. After a burger has been eaten, the user can move this item to a list of already eaten burgers. 

## Challenges
1. This was the first time I've split up code using the MVC pattern, so it was difficult keeping track of which files are doing what task. It was also a bit confusing to create custom ORM, but I have an understanding of how other ORMs such as Sequelize work through this project. I deployed on Heroku for the first time as well, but learned a lot through troubleshooting.
